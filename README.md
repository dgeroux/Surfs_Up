# Surfs_Up

## Overview 
Our client is looking to start a business - Surf n' Shake, a shop that sells surfboards and serves ice cream to locals and tourists alike. After putting together a strong busines plan, our client has reached out to potential investors. One of the investors showed alot of interest but wants to run analytics on weather data to determine a few things before solidifying his investment. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results 
### Below is the statistical data for the temperature in June on the island of O'ahu between 2010 and 2017

 ### Major Points
 ..*June has slightly more temperature obvservations, which means there are some missing data points for December. Luckily, the data set is large enough relative to the amount of missing data that the missing data points don't have a significant effect on the findings.
 ..*The low standard deviation for each month implies a relatively small spread across the temperature observations. This makes sense, as O'ahu weather does not seem to fluctuate significantly.
 ..*The statistical data for each month are very similar.
 
 ## Summary 
By comparing the statistic summary of the two months, we can conclude that temperature patterns remain steady throughout the whole year. However, there are two more queries that we need to include to get a better understanding of the weather on Oahu. Although temperatures may remain about the same throughout the year, precipitation may not and would also have a significant impact of the business's sustainability. Doing a statistically summary of the precipitation patterns during the months of June and December will give us a better picture of the overall weather pattern.

Another query that can be created to help us further our analysis is comparing the most active stations to the weather patterns. This can help us narrow down the best location by giving us the most popular station combined with the most stable weather patterns.
